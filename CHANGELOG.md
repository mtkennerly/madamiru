## Unreleased

* Added:
  * Partial translations into Polish and French.
    (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/madamiru))
* Fixed:
  * The `crop` content fit now works correctly for videos.
    Previously, it acted the same as `stretch`.
  * If you drag-and-dropped multiple files into the window
    while there was more than one grid open,
    only one of the files would be inserted into the grid that you selected.

## v0.1.0 (2024-12-12)

* Initial release.
